### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function myFunction() {
  let elements = document.getElementsByName("toggle");
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    let element1 = elements[i]
      if (element1.style.display === "block") {
        element1.style.display = "none";
      } else if (element1.style.display === "none") {
        element1.style.display = "block";
      } else if (element1.className === "menu-open") {
        element1.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        element1.style.display = "block";
      }
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Navigation Bar Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_mobile_navbar) - Navigation bars seem like a major daunting task, but with this website I was able to add at least a low level implementation.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
